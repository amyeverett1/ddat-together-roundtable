         <p>The Digital, Data and Technology roundtables are informal face to face sessions with the DDaT senior management team. They are an opportunity for relaxed ‘get to know you and your work’ conversations with colleagues and senior managers who you might not usually meet in your day to day activities and to help build wider awareness, understanding and collaboration across DDaT.</p>

            <p>All sessions are open to everyone across DDaT (subject to business commitments). You do not need to book in advance; places will be available on a first come first served basis on the day. You are not expected to travel specifically to attend a session; further roundtables will be held at each site on a rolling basis so there will be plenty of opportunities to attend throughout the year.</p>

            <p>There is no fixed agenda or formal presentation and you can raise any topic you wish at these events. This is your roundtable to find out more about the wider work of DDaT and discuss developments, local issues and concerns. It is also an opportunity to share information about your work, what your team is doing and your successes.  You can also raise questions and issues in advance by emailing the DDaT Communications team.  Alternatively, if you’d prefer to submit questions and/or flag issues anonymously, please <a href="http://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/RoundtableQuestions/">submit questions or queries using this link</a>.</p>

  <div>

<div class="wrapper">
    <img src="/safe.jpg" alt="safe to talk about logo"/>
   <strong><h4 class="space-space">The suggested roundtable discussion topic is to be confirmed.</h4></strong>
   <!-- <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>'Let’s Talk About...' is a team briefing tool which is distributed to grades SEO and above for discussing with their teams. Each month we will highlight a specific topic for you to discuss. The topic will be an issue which is important to Capabilities &amp; Resources (C&amp;R) and on which we would like you to feed back your team’s thoughts.</p>

    <p>'Let’s Talk About...' gives you and your team an opportunity to get involved in how we shape our business, share good practice and make your voice heard. Each issue of 'Let’s Talk About...' will be sponsored by a leader in C&amp;R. This issue is sponsored by James Martin from Home Office Cyber Security Centre and is about Cyber Security.</p>
 
    <h3>This Month</h3>
<p>The vast majority of us spend at least part of each working day in front of a computer. Technology is continuing to revolutionise the way we live our lives and carry out our jobs; however, these rapid developments have been matched by the spread of increasingly sophisticated cyber crime. As the recent attack on the NHS and other institutions demonstrated, the UK’s infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber crime and the consequences of a security breach can be costly and potentially devastating.</p>
    
<p>The nature of cyber security means that we all share responsibility for the protection of the Home Office’s IT system, not just the IT security team. We all play a vital role in keeping our systems secure; one mistake is all it can take for the defences to be breached and an attack to be successful.</p>
    
<p>In this month’s 'Let’s Talk About...', which is sponsored by James Martin from the Home Office Cyber Security Centre, we’ll be focusing on how you can keep Home Office systems and data safe.</p>
    
<strong>Keeping Home Office data and systems safe</strong>
<p>The Home Office receives 170,000 spam emails a month and a proportion of these messages are hitting staff inboxes.</p>
<p>Senders of these spam messages tried to masquerade themselves as Home Office staff by using a Home Office user’s name and email address to visually trick the recipient into reading the email and clicking on attached documents and links.</p>
<p>We need to create an environment where staff are confident recognising potentially suspicious emails and <a href="http://www.smartcdn.co.uk/homeofficeR4/mailresponse.asp?tid=10945&em=3903619&turl=https://horizon.fcos.gsi.gov.uk/news/alert-issued-spam-emails">know how to respond if this does occur</a>. If people send their email to <a href="http://www.smartcdn.co.uk/homeofficeR4/mailresponse.asp?tid=10945&em=3903619&turl=mailto:spam@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">CSOC</a> we update our spam filter so no one else will receive that email. You can make a difference.</p>
<p>Finally, refrain from using your Home Office email address for external logins and mailing lists. These details are sold to criminals and provide fresh opportunities to launch cyber attacks.</p>
<strong>Remember – one click could result in our information being stolen, cost money, damage our reputation or stop us from doing our work.</strong>

<li>Q:  What information would you like to see on cyber security? </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>A summary of the feedback received on this topic will be shared as part of the next 'Let’s Talk About...' in July.</p>
