  <div>

<div class="wrapper">
<p>This is our second DDaT Together event. This time of year is always busy as we approach the primary annual performance management cycle: even more so this year because the Home Office’s performance management model is changing significantly. It’s therefore really important that we take time to discuss this critical process together and talk about how we can embed these changes successfully in DDaT. It is also an opportunity to update you on the work we are doing in various other areas of our People agenda.</p>

<p>Whilst this event will be open to everyone in DDaT (civil servants and contractors, managers and non-managers) there are limited spaces and hence there will be a one week ‘priority booking’ window for civil servants who have responsibilities for managing other staff. After this period, places will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis to everyone else in the department.</p>
 
<p>You must register to attend the event as places are limited. From today until 9th March, we invite Civil Servants with line management responsibilities to register. Please only register within this window if you are in this category. From 10th March onwards, we invite registrations from all of you.</p>
 
<p>Don’t forget to bring your Home Office pass. We don’t want you to wear it but you must show it when you arrive at The Kia Oval. If you don’t bring it, you may not be able to take part for security reasons.</p>
 
<p>Any questions? Ask the <a href="mailto:hoddatcommunications@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk"> DDaT communications team</a> and we will reply promptly. </p>

  <div>

<div class="wrapper">
    <p>Last time we didn’t specify a theme for lightening talk topics but this time, given the focus of the day, we want to hear from you about topics related to leadership, management, learning, career progression, pay and reward and related themes. What makes a good manager in your opinion? What was your best learning experience? What can others learn from your career journey? What does working at the Home Office mean to you and what would make it better? How can we make work-life balance better for all of us? What are the best low-cost or no-cost learning ideas out there? What are the best online resources for techies?....the list of areas to explore is endless.</p>
 
<p>Be brave and share your thoughts. Presenting in front of 350 of your peers is definitely a development opportunity! You can talk with or without slides, you can speak as an individual or on behalf of a team, and you can present solo or as a group – just remember to cover your topic in three minutes!</p>
        
    <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:ann.blundy@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">Ann Blundy</a> if you would like to take part. </p>
