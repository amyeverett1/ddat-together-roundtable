<div class="img left"><img src="/img/img1.png"/></div> <p>The Digital, Data and Technology roundtables are informal face to face sessions with the DDaT senior management team. They are an opportunity for relaxed ‘get to know you and your work’ conversations with colleagues and senior managers who you might not usually meet in your day to day activities and to help build wider awareness, understanding and collaboration across DDaT. We may also theme some of the conversations to address key or topical subjects.</p>
 <div class="img right"><img src="/img/img2.jpg"/></div> 
    <p>The first quarterly roundtable in Sheffield will be hosted by Jackie Keane, Head of Immigration IT and Dave Merritt, Chief Operating Officer. </p>
 
<p>All sessions are open to everyone across DDaT (subject to business commitments) and <strong>places must be booked through this app</strong>. Tickets are available on a first come first served basis and waiting lists will be in operation. You are not expected to travel specifically to attend a session; further roundtables will be held at each site on a rolling basis so there will be plenty of opportunities to attend throughout the year. Roundtables will not be used as a channel to announce any major updates – if required, such information would be shared in the usual ways with all staff.</p>
 
<p>There is no fixed agenda or formal presentation and you can raise any topic you wish at these events. This is your roundtable to find out more about the wider work of DDaT and discuss developments, local issues and concerns. It is also an opportunity to share information about your work, what your team is doing and your successes.  You can also raise questions and issues in advance by emailing the DDaT Communications team.

  <p>These events are coordinated by <a href="mailto:HODDaTcommunications@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">DDaT Communications</a> and <strong>Rachelle Hembury</strong> from the team will be supporting Jackie and Dave at the Sheffield session.  Please contact us if you have any queries. </p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-comment fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>  <span>Let’s Talk About</span></h3>
  <div>

<div class="wrapper">
    <img src="/safe.jpg" alt="safe to talk about logo"/>
    <strong><h4 class="space-space">The suggested roundtable discussion topic is this month’s Let’s Talk About topic - Creating an environment where it is safe to challenge</h4></strong>
    <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>'Let’s talk about…’ gives you and your team an opportunity to get involved in how we shape our business, share good practice and make your voice heard. Each issue of Let’s talk about will be sponsored by a leader in Capabilities &amp; Resources (C&amp;R).</p>

<p>This issue is sponsored by Rowena Fenning from the C&amp;R Delivery team, and is about creating an environment where it is safe to challenge.</p>
 
    <h3>This Month</h3>
<p>Each year the People Survey asks us the extent to which we agree with the statement ‘I think it is safe to challenge the way things are done in the Home Office’. In 2016, 38% of respondents in C&amp;R agreed or strongly agreed, while 30% disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>

<p>Creating an environment where more of us feel that it is safe to challenge is a key priority for the C&amp;R SMT this year and supports us in embedding our principles. Whatever the nature of the challenge – be it around behaviours or the handling of a piece of work – it is important for the wellbeing of the organisation as much as for individuals that people can give and receive challenge in a constructive way.</p>

<p>This month, we would like teams to have a discussion about making C&amp;R a place where it is increasingly safe to challenge. Your feedback will inform a programme of work to better understand the issues and actively promote positive change.</p>
    
    <h3>Suggested Questions</h3>

    <p>Please take time to discuss the following questions at your next team meeting:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When deciding if you agree with the statement ‘I think it is safe to challenge the way things are done in the Home Office’, what sort of thing do you think of challenging? [e.g. Local processes or ways of handling a piece of work? Departmental processes?Unacceptable behaviour? Misconduct? A breach of the civil service code? More than one of these? Something else?]</li> 
<li>What are the most important factors in giving you confidence to challenge something? [e.g. Your relationship with your line manager and your team? Access to an independent process? Regular consultation or opportunities to provide structured feedback? Reassurance about how your challenge will be dealt with? Something else?]</li>
<li>Do you have any specific suggestions for ways we can make Capabilities &amp; Resources a place where it is increasingly safe to challenge?</li>
    </ul>
